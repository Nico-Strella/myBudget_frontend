# myBudget_frontend
A simple personal App that I made to manage my budget by registering my incomes and outcomes.

## Features:

- ADD income/outcome with detail and price (currency fixed Thai Baht)
- EDIT income/outome (only detail and price)
- DETELE income/outome
- DELETE all income/outome
- Filter by year/month to see only income/outcome from the selected month
- Total income/outcome and the current badget (money that you have after removing outcome from your wallet)
- Data and preferred filter is stored in your phone (because it's an app for my personal use. Sync with cloud database is unnecessary)
- Data can be exported by email as .csv file
